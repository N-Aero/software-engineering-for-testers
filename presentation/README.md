# Presentation

The presentation is built in [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). Such that you not need any pre-installed Keynote or Office in your development system.

## Prerequisites

```
node@12.x.x      // Use nvm while .nvmrc is available
npm              // Latest available that is compatible with NodeJS 12
Chrome@latest
```

## Run the presentation

```
npm run start
```

This will run the presentation on port `8000`.
