            <li>Creating a clean code base is a team effort. Everybody needs to take a step, and change what they were doing.</li>
            <li>This is not a Science. Nobody can prescribe a recipe for this. It are only hints, and experience to apply those hints in real life</li>
            <li>Little things really matter. You should not vacuum clean without taking big items from the floor. Heck, takingÂ the big items from the floor is actually the easy part</li>
            <li>Leave the code base a better place one step at a time.</li>
