                Code will always exist. It is suggested that nobody has to write code in the future, but this has been
                posed years ago.
                The reality shows that the need for developers, and thus the production of software increases. And
                therefor, we should manage this.

                Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements
            </li>
            <li>
                As they added more and more features, the
                code got worse and worse until they simply could not manage it any longer. It was the bad
                code that brought the company down.

                Code has a lifecycle, it is written down, then read by others to understand it so a system can change.
                Even when that specific line is changed, it has to be read before it is changed.
                Sense making of existing code is a one of the most important prerequisites
                Of course this only refers to meaningful code, that is written to make money or make the world a better
                place.
            </li>
            <li>
                Being able to single-handed change a piece of code in a system <strong>without breaking it</strong> is
                very valuable.
                Waiting for others to change it (for example the system owner) make you wait, and thus costs time.
                Introducing a bug might me more costly.

    <h3>Predictability</h3>

    <p>
        For a business, it can be crucial to know the pace in which we can develop.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the code is a mess, untested, not automated, the cost of development is unpredictable.

            Martin's book is one of the most referred literature regarding good code. 'Clean' is a well-known term in
            the industry nowadays.
            The main points from his book are the points of interests mentioned here.
            They are more or less sorted by precedence. For example, readability is more important than less code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the content in this presentation is influenced by or related to that book.
